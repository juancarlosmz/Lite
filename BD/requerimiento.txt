The 'lite' app could be embedded in on a page on your website or an external page. (same quote) This app will get the information from chinabrands using their API, so the data will be synchronized, this app will allow the customers to create a list using an account (you will be able to create those accounts), and it will be saved. Unfortunately, this message is generated by the app and we can't change it. We will include the following features: - Display China- and U.S.-warehoused products. - Sync product cost and inventory (U.S.+China). - Filters for U.S./China inventories. - The ability to save selected products to a list and send out the list when done. We will create a functionality that updates the app every 10 or 5 minutes, because chinabrands don't have weebhooks that could allow us to make the changes automatically when they update their products. ***This app wont import products tho shopify, it will only be used as requested, to gain information and allow customers to create a list of products that will be added directly
